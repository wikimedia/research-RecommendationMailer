Hi {{user}},

The Research Team at the Wikimedia Foundation is working on finding popular and important articles in other-language Wikipedias that do not exist in {{lang}} Wikipedia yet. The following three articles exist in English Wikipedia and are considered important for other Wikipedias. Based on your history of contribution to Wikipedia, we think you are a great candidate for contributing to one of these articles. Starting any of these articles would be a great first step in making more knowledge available in {{lang}}.

Thank you for your time.
